Overview:

This Memory Game is a console-based application developed using the C programming language. The game challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of shapes shown on the screen. Each round, a random shape is displayed with a circle around it, and the player must input the correct sequence of shapes using the designated controls.

2. Controls:
    W - Up,
    A - Left,
    S - Down,
    D - Right

How to Play:
1. Start the game by entering g when prompted.
2. The game will display a series of shapes in a random sequence.
3. After the shapes are displayed, you must input the sequence using the controls (W, A, S, D).
4. If you input the correct sequence, the game progresses to the next round with an increased sequence length.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

Features:
1. Shape Display: The game randomly selects and displays one of four shapes (triangle, square, diamond, X) each round.
